# LaTeX resume template

This is the template I use for my own resume. It was originally a fork of
[Harshavardhan Gadgil's Data Engineer Resume](opensorceror/Data-Engineer-Resume-LaTeX),
but I pulled it into a non-forked repository when I added the modified cover
letter from [Claud D. Park's Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV).

Needs LuaLaTex or XeLaTex to compile.
